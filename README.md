# Simple-Intrest-Calculator
A Simple Interest Calculator built with an intuitive UI where users input the start date, end date, initial amount, and interest rate (in currency per annum, not percentage). The tool computes the time period (in years, months, and days), calculated interest, and total amount. Includes "Calculate" and "Reset" buttons for ease of use.
